# AV-DEMO

av-demo is an exploration of web gl + web audio, mainly for learning purposes. The main engine is a port / extension of the rendering framework in [EXP](https://github.com/nfagan/EXP).

The examples/ folder currently houses a couple of demos of basic a/v synchronization.

A few demos are currently online: [here](https://av-demo.herokuapp.com/demos)
